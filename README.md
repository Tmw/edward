Edward depends on a pre-trained Tensorflow model as explained in this [blogpost](https://towardsdatascience.com/background-removal-with-deep-learning-c4f2104b3157). The fully pre-trained model can be found over their Gitlab [Repository](https://gitlab.com/fast-science/background-removal-server/tree/master/webapp/model).

_Note; the model in this repository is merely a mirror. In both cases; pull using [git lfs](https://git-lfs.github.com/)._
